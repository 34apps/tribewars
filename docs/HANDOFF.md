# Handoff — Clanfire

Written 2026-11-04 (HEAD `be53d22`+). Read this first, then `docs/AI-WORKFLOW.md`, the top of
`CHANGELOG.md`, and `grep` `NEXT_STEPS.md` for your topic.

## Last run

2026-11-04 (`dd8c40a`): population retuned (`POP_CAP_GROWTH` 1.2, `POP_BUILDING_GROWTH` 1.1) so a maxed village has
~3,100 pop left for troops. Numbers only in `config.ts`; `GAME_DESIGN.md` updated. Checks passed.
Very next step: owner plays and says if the army size feels right; tune the two constants if not.
(Older notes below.)

2026-11-04 (`149035b`, `676d342`): abandoned villages now have 6 pictures, one ruined version per growth
stage (`abandoned-stage-1..6.svg`, same point steps as player villages), replacing the 3 old ruins. Earlier today:
ruins same scale as villages, protection dome fits its tile (`7bdc1e7`); villages tried at 1.3x but that spilled over
tiles, so `be53d22` set `VILLAGE_DRAW_SCALE` back to 1 (each sprite fills one tile). Don't scale above 1 again.
Checks passed, build + preview build ok; map viewed in the preview at 1440 px.
Very next step: owner looks at the map on their Mac. Design generator scripts for the abandoned sprites lived only
in a cloud scratchpad; edit the SVGs in `design/sprites/map/` directly and copy them to `apps/web/src/art/map/`.

## How the owner works (important)

- Owner (Metin) is not a developer, writes Turkish/English, wants **short, plain answers** and
  copy-paste commands. One change at a time, so a disliked change can be undone alone.
- Day-to-day dev runs on the owner's Mac with `agent "task"` (= `npm run agent -- "task"`,
  `scripts/agent/run.ts`), billed to platform.claude.com API credits (not the Max plan). Every run starts
  fresh; the previous final answer (`.agent/last-reply.md`, ≤60 lines) is passed as context; `--continue`
  resumes fully (expensive, avoid); default budget $10 (`--budget N`).
- Runner permissions are an allow list (`dontAsk` mode): chained commands need every part allowed.
  `rm`, `git reset/checkout/stash`, `npm install`, `curl` are denied — ask the owner to run those.
- Each run ends with: check → commit → CHANGELOG/NEXT_STEPS → "Last run" above → docs commit → `git push origin main`.

## State in one minute

- **Clanfire** (GitHub repo `34apps/tribewars`) is playable: villages, 4 resources, buildings, troops,
  raids, growing abandoned villages, tribes + diplomacy + forum + chat, tribe warfare (scouts, support),
  Drillyard research queue + ranks, Market + shipments, rankings + profiles, mail, staff tooling
  (tickets, reports, mute/ban), population cap, cancel within 2 min, rate limits, multi-account guard.
- `npm run dev` = expanding 500x500 world at real pace (own DB `clanfire-world.sqlite`);
  `npm run dev:fast` = speed 10. Preview: `npm run build:preview` → `apps/preview/dist/index.html`.
- Style **D · Toy Diorama** is in the game: village view (town square + campfire centre, Drillyard on its
  own plot), isometric map with 6 growth stages + ruins, chieftains. Sprites in `design/sprites/`.
- Ask Mags AI advisor is off (owner: no credit spend) unless `ADVISOR_ENABLED=true`.
- Tests: engine 223, server 210, all green. Not deployed; no CI.

## Owner decisions (don't re-ask)

- Original game, never copy Tribal Wars/Travian. Web first (360 px phone + 1280–1440 px desktop), native later.
- Keep Toy Diorama; polish, don't restyle. Keep the current map look (no clearings, labels always shown,
  normal hills). Art stays swappable (sprite registries).
- No scrollbars inside desktop side panels; server tests for every new endpoint; security gate per feature.

## Open

- Owner: Tripo3D test (3D models rendered to flat sprites) — suggested first: Town Hall, Lumber Camp,
  Iron Mine in Toy Diorama style; map village stages later if it works. Check Tripo's commercial licence.
- Owner: approve design rows H–L; practice-ruin decision; hosting; `GAME_DESIGN.md` §15 questions.
- Dev: many screens built but never viewed in a browser (see CHANGELOG "not viewed"): Drillyard, Market,
  Mail, staff screens, town square. View them at 360 and 1440 px.

## Traps

- Vite dev proxy needs `changeOrigin: false` (server's Origin check).
- `node:sqlite`; old DBs get columns added in place. `data/`, `*.sqlite` are git-ignored.
- Preview must stay CSP-safe: sql.js asm build, no wasm/eval/network.
- Scout tests rely on scout village Keen 2–5.
- Dark/light token contexts: set explicit text colours on light surfaces inside dark cards.
- Never put the API key in the repo, a commit or chat; it lives in the owner's `~/.zshrc` only.
